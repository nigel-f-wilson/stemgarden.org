Cut stalks will regrow, but each stalk will only bear fruit once. The root cluster survives ans sends up new stalks, called "pups" to replace those that reach maturity and die. While blooming, one of the bright red leaves of the "bell" opens each day to reveal a row of flowers that will turn into a "hand" of bananas.'},{name:"papaya",imgUrl:b.ib,detailImgUrl1:b.jb,detailImgUrl2:b.hb,detailText:"Ripe papaya are a beutiful deep orange color but they can also be shredded and made into a salad while still green. Most papaya sold at grocery stores in the U.S. are picked prematurely to improve shelf-life, but as a result they never fully ripen. I leave the fruits on the trees until they are ready to eat. This way they get much sweeter and develop a more interesting flavor. Papaya is a key ingredient in my homegrown fruit smoothies. I sell them green, ripe, or frozen in quart bags."},{name:"fig",imgUrl:b.E,detailImgUrl1:b.D,detailImgUrl2:b.C,detailText:"Figs are available throughout the summer.

It commands a high price per pound while still being a relatively low maintenance crop. Its broad leaves help shade out weeds and other competition and unlike the fruits we grow, which need picked daily when they are in season, turmeric only requires a few days of hands on work each year. I sell turmeric flowers for use in salads in July. Freshly dug turmeric is available year round but it keeps best when harvested at the end of the dry season. Each October, I dig up all the turmeric, break apart the big root clusters. I replant about 20% of the rhizomes the same day and make the rest available for sale."},{name:"loquat",imgUrl:b.W,detailImgUrl1:b.X,detailImgUrl2:b.Y,detailText:"Not related to Cumquats! Loquats are also known as Japanese plums or 'Misbeliefs' because the fruit ripens so early in the year you almost wouldn't believe it! Loquats bloom in December and January, providing an excellent food source for honey bees during an otherwise scarce time of year. By late February the trees are covered in delicious fruit. They can be found all over New Orleans, being a popular ornamental tree in landscapes. I sell the fruit whole and my partner makes a delicious sorbet from the rest."},{name:"other",imgUrl:b.Bb,detailImgUrl1:b.w,detailImgUrl2:b.h,detailText:"Most of the crops listed on this page come from established trees but we also grow a rotation of seasonal veggies.
