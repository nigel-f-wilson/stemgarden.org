We hit it off immediately and a few months has turned into many happy years. I built a screened-in kitchen so Olive could cook without getting mosquito bites. I designed and built two tiny houses on trailers, the Tea Room and the Classroom. I took things apart and reused the materials and gradually I got better at building things.
